# ðŸ§­ Gold Layer Data Catalog

## **Overview**

The **Gold Layer** represents the **curated, business-ready layer** of the data warehouse.
It serves as the **single source of truth (SSOT)** for analytics, dashboards, and reporting â€” built from cleansed and conformed data in the Silver Layer.

This layer is modeled using a **star schema**, consisting of **dimension tables** that describe business entities and **fact tables** that record measurable business events.
