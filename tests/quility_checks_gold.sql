Layer: Gold Layer â€“ Data Quality Validation
===============================================================================
Author: Chinedu Anele  
Role: Data Engineer

Overview:
    This script performs post-transformation quality checks on the **Gold Layer**
    to ensure data integrity, referential accuracy, and consistency across all 
    analytical views. It validates that dimension and fact relationships are 
    correctly established and that no data anomalies exist in the dimensional model.

Checks Performed:
    1. gold.dim_customers  
       - Validates uniqueness of the surrogate key (customer_key).  
       - Ensures no duplicate or null records exist in the dimension.

    2. gold.dim_products  
       - Confirms the uniqueness and stability of product surrogate keys.  
       - Detects potential duplication that could affect join accuracy.

    3. gold.fact_sales  
       - Verifies referential integrity between fact and dimension tables.  
       - Ensures that every fact record maps correctly to valid dimension keys.

Key Highlights:
    - Ensures a **clean, reliable Star Schema** structure for BI consumption.  
    - Prevents data duplication and orphaned records in analytical reporting.  
    - Strengthens the overall trust and auditability of the Gold Layer.

Execution Notes:
    - Run this script after Gold Layer view creation and population.  
    - Any returned rows indicate data integrity issues requiring investigation.  
    - Results should ideally return **no records** if the data is consistent.
